## Interview with the TA

- Participants:
  - Jason Yuan
  - Zhe Fan (Jefferson) Li
  - Maggie Dang
  - Michael Do
  - Ohmasinh Negi
  - Qing Yu (Rick) Lan

Practices to continue:

- For hotfixes we branch from the broken branch rather than master
- we squash and merge our branches
- automated test suite for backend is great

New practices:

- we should review our stories a few times before we start the feature to ensure we're actually implementing what was asked

Harmful practices:

- Code review isn't very thorough so some bugs get missed

Best/Worst Moments:

- Branching was even better this sprint with the hot fixes
- great communication
- it was great seeing the culmination of all our work finally come together
- it was great seeing stuff we planned at the start of the semester finally show up

Unfinished tasks:
