## Interview with the TA

- Participants:
  - Jason Yuan
  - Zhe Fan (Jefferson) Li
  - Maggie Dang
  - Michael Do
  - Ohmasinh Negi
  - Qing Yu (Rick) Lan

- Practices to continue:
  - Good branching and pull requests.
  - Split up frontend and backend team.
  - Fast interaction between teams.
  - Efficient and meaningful standups.
  - Backend testing.
  
- New practices:
  - We assigned one person to do all APIs, we should instead,
    - plan the API together
    - think more about API design in general
  - Create a new branch, the dev branch, before the master branch.
  - Label which sprint each task belongs to.
  - Have everyone update the sprintx.md file whenever they make a new task.
  - Everyone should delete their branch once it has been merged with Master/Dev.
  
- Harmful practices:
  - Too many pull requests that were unrelated to the main story.

- Best and Worst Experience:
  - Our best experience was seeing the frontend come together with the backend.
  - Our worst experience was constantly iterating the API design because the frontend and backend teams didn't design the API together.

- Unfinished tasks:

  - LIL-14 Allow users to view other users ACS history
