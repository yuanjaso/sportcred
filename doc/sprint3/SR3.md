## Interview with the TA

- Participants:
  - Jason Yuan
  - Zhe Fan (Jefferson) Li
  - Maggie Dang
  - Michael Do
  - Ohmasinh Negi
  - Qing Yu (Rick) Lan

Practices to continue:

- new branching style
- greater focus on features rather than trying to do everything

New practices:

- we should do the squash and merge properly when merging branches
- hotfix branch is off the front end branch that needs the hotfix rather than off develop

Harmful practices:

- premature merges causing merge conflicts

Best/Worst Moments:

- seeing everything come together with the front end and backend
- had fun designing specs, it wasn't too difficult but it also wasn't trivial
- Jeff liked how every branched off his branch and merged back to his branch.
- Branching was very clean this sprint.

Unfinished tasks:
LIL-93 (bug)Make sure the trivia questions/answers pairs are correct
