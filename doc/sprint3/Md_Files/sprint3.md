<b>Sprint Goal:</b><br>
The sprint goal for sprint 3 is to showcase debate feature.<br>
Users can debate other users, who are in the same ACS tier, on some topic.<br>
Any users can "watch" the debates and rate each person's input in the debates.<br>
The ratings can affect a user's ACS score.
- If a comment has at least 4 different ratings and the average rating is below 4.0, then the user who posted the comment will lose 5 ACS score points.
- If a comment has at least 4 different ratings and the average rating is above 6.0, then the user who posted the comment will gain 5 ACS score points.
