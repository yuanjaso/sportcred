## Interview with the TA

- Participants:
  - Jason Yuan
  - Zhe Fan (Jefferson) Li
  - Maggie Dang
  - Michael Do
  - Ohmasinh Negi
  - Qing Yu (Rick) Lan

Practices to continue:

- new branching structure
- we spent more time earlier on figuring out the API
- Worked together with front end on API
- Continuously updated the API docs

New practices:

- write test cases first (person designing the API should write the test cases for the backend first) (TDD)
- Involve more people in the API design. Definitely miss things with 2 people and we get different perspectives.
- Everything about front end is smooth.
- Have each person update the sprintx.md user task table right after they create the task on Jira.
- Have one person check the master branch on the last day of the sprint to check that everything is in there.

Harmful practices:

- Didn't involve everyone in the API discussion.
- Have each person update the sprintx.md user task table right after they create the task on Jira.
- Have one person check the master branch on the last day of the sprint to check that everything is in there.

Best/Worst Moments:
Best: The smoothness of this sprint.
Best: When connecting the front end to the back end, it worked smoothly.
Best: Testing really helped us catch bugs.
Best: The backend team didn't need to see the front end code.
Worst: Redesigning some of the schema to meet the new requirements.

Unfinished tasks:

- LIL-59 Dynamically show list of sports on profile page
- LIL-6 Multiplayer Trivia
