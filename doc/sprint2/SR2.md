## Interview with the TA

- Participants:
  - Jason Yuan
  - Zhe Fan (Jefferson) Li
  - Maggie Dang
  - Michael Do
  - Ohmasinh Negi
  - Qing Yu (Rick) Lan

Practices to continue:

- Continue using the new branching structure.
- Continue spending more time earlier on designing the API.
- Continue having the back end and front end teams work together to design the API.
- Continuously update the API docs.

New practices:

- Write test cases before coding. The person/people who designed the API should write the test cases for the backend.
- Involve more people in the API design. By involving more people in the API design, we can get more ideas and perspectives.
- Have each person update the sprintx.md user task table right after they create the task on Jira.
- Have one person check the master branch on the last day of the sprint to check that everything is in there.

Harmful practices:

- Didn't involve everyone in the API design discussion.
- Didn't have everyone update sprint2.md with their user tasks each time they created one.

Best/Worst Moments:

- Best: Testing really helped us catch bugs.
- Worst: Redesigning some of the schema to meet the new requirements.

Unfinished tasks:

- LIL-59 Dynamically show list of sports on profile page
- LIL-6 Multiplayer Trivia
