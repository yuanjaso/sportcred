## [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/nba/)
- One similarity between the two websites is that both websites have a discussion forum where people can post their opinions and discuss them. 
- Some key features that SportsCred has and Reddit doesn’t are that SportsCred allows users to play trivia games, against other users or the computer, allow users to debate one another, allow users to make picks and predictions. Furthermore, SportsCred has a scoring system, the ACS, where users can gain or lose points based on how well they perform in the trivia games, debates, and the picks and predictions.
- SportsCred is better for sports enthusiasts who not only want to give their opinions, they also want to showcase their knowledge of sport’s trivia and debate with other people. SportsCred’s target audience is competitive sports enthusiasts.
- Reddit didn’t focus on these users because it is an online community bulletin board or an interactive newspaper. All of the subreddits, including r/nba, were created by people who were interested in discussing that topic. If enough sports enthusiasts use both SportsCred and Reddit, specifically r/nba, they may incorporate some features from SportsCred into r/nba.

## [Bodog](https://bodog.eu/)

## [Sports Debatable](https://sportsdebatable.com/)
- Sportsdebatable is an app that allows users to create, share, and participate in sports debates.
- Users create debate rooms where others can enter and share their thoughts. Specific debates can also be shared via other social media such as twitter to recruit new users
- 1 key difference is that Sportsdebatable allows debate rooms with many users with no competitive aspect, while our product focuses on 1 on 1 debate with a defined winner at the end. 
- Our product is more suited for a more competitive and serious sports fan, while Sportsdebatable focuses on a more casual fan.
- Sportsdebatable didn’t focus on these users because it is focused on a more social and casual atmosphere, a competitive system might create an intimidating tone for the debate rooms.

## [Quizup](https://quizup.com/)
- Quizup is an app that allows users to complete 1 on 1 on any topic.
- All quizzes are created by players
- Because all quizzes are user-created, there is a seemingly unending number of quizzes and topics available, but the quality isn’t guaranteed.
- Players are then ranked based on their knowledge of the topic.
- Our product’s trivia feature is more suitable for a more serious sports fan, as all quizzes are professionally curated.
- Quizup did not focus on these users as they focus on a much wider audience, and have no resources to be able to curate quizzes for every topic. Therefore they need to rely on users to generate quizzes.
