# How did you organize the team? What tools did you use, if any?

- Discord (communication)
- Google Docs
- Figma (storyboarding)
- git, GitHub
- Strawpoll (voting)

# How did you make decisions?

Strawpoll vote and talked about it on Discord.

# How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

We discussed both the priority and points of each user story over Discord. Through some back and forth we would agree on a value once there are no objections. For the point estimates we used the fibonacci numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5). There was about 1 - 2 rounds of voting for the point estimate.

# Did you meet in person or online?
